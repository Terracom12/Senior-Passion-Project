# Giant Octopus Game
### Brainstorming
- Eight tentacles reach out and grab fish where you click
- Avoiding pufferfish/lionfish, eating smaller fish?
  - Randomly spawn, **make sure to balance**
- Oddly shaped terrain to avoid?
- Survival game, need to eat in order to stay alive
- Goal is treasure at the bottom of the ocean

### TODO:
- [ ] Program simple behaviors and goals
   - [ ] Find Temp assets
- [ ] More permanent assets and animations
- [ ] Learn/Document (+Polish?)
