# Present Run
A platformer-type game created for the holiday project in my AP CSP class. Another reason for this project was so that I could learn the basics of developing games with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

This is a extremely simple platformer with your only goals being to:
- Collect as many presents as you can
- Reach the end of the level (the chimney) before the timer runs out
